## Overview

### The challenge

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt). (This is the web if you want to take the challenge or other frontend good challenges)

It consists on building out a dynamic job listing with tag/keyword filter and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using any tool I like. It has to be responsive, at least mobile(375px) and desktop(1440px)
